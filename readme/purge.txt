for rewards system:
- purge pointAccounts.db for the user_id that is associated with that name
- remove coupon once used

pointAccounts.db should contain the user email as the key and the PointsAccount obj as the value

need a database that stores all the user's available vouchers
The Coupon obj will be associated with the email of the user
it will use stripe and the Coupon class blueprint to create the voucher to get the coupon_id which can be used during checkout
after use, the coupon will be deleted using the stripe function using the coupon_id
the user's available vouchers will also be removed with that Coupon_obj_blueprint

to make it simple, a promocode will also take the form of a coupon, just that it can be viewed by all users
and it is not deleted unless the admin deletes the coupon code

guests can only use promo codes but cannot get points or redeem vouchers
hence only users can have pointAccounts
