Reward Management functions:

CreateCoupon()


Note: A coupon should be created without the customer id first, so when the customer creates
the coupon, only he or she can use it, however for a promo code, it should be visible to all customers
hence create a shelve called CustomerCoupons.db that stores the available coupons and promo code tags in this format
coupon_id:customer
if customer == None:
	it is a promo code
once a promo code is used, it should be deleted

to be clear, CustomerCoupons only stores the types of coupons that can be redeemed
this serves only as a blueprint which contains coupon_id consisting of name and the coupon object consisting of necessary attributes to 
create a coupon or promo code
